         <p>
              <span>I am not a necessary voice</span>
              <span>The future is not my choice</span>
              <span>Proverbially one of the boys</span>
              <span>I am only adding to the noise</span>
            </p>

            <p>
              <span>I am the status quo</span>
              <span>I denominate the ratio</span>
              <span>Not a martyr or a cherry bomb</span>
              <span>I am the echo of a fading song</span>
            </p>

            <p>
              <span>Listen to my silence</span>
            </p>

    lyricText: |-2
              <p>
                <span>Don't call it a sickness</span>
                <span>Don't call it the blues</span>
                <span>I'm nobody's victim</span>
                <span>And if I was, what would it be to you?</span>
                <span>My earthly offering</span>
                <span>Devoid of salt</span>
                <span>A youth spent squandering</span>
                <span>And I know full well my life is my fault</span>
              </p>

              <p>
                <span>My life is my fault</span>
              </p>
              <p>
                <span>Self deprecation</span>
                <span>Poison to the soul</span>
                <span>But one ounce of clarity</span>
                <span>Can return a hundred fold</span>
                <span>I donâ€™t need your pretense</span>
                <span>Pity or resolve</span>
                <span>I just need to know full well</span>
                <span>When anything goes my life is my fault</span>
              </p>
              <p>
                <span>My life is my fault</span>
              </p>
