The push pull incentive\n            of aging and irrelevance. One inconsequential notion in a long array\n            of impotence. And yet, we exist. We breathe. We sweat.

And now.</p>\n\n          <p>\n            Lone Control is born from common desire. Desire to break free of the\n            predetermination of the daily millstone grind. This is not a\n            hardened desire, but one that continues to bubble and burst with\n            time. What Chris and Gerrit each bring to the creative circle rarely\n            overlaps. These are unfitting pieces, made to lay together\n            awkwardly, unrefined and unhinged.\n          </p>\n\n          <p>\n            Chris and Gerrit met at a downtown Phoenix bar. The former, from an\n            El Paso punk background, fresh to the city. The latter, a return\n            resident, after years apart making electronic music in Seattle. The\n            two hit it off immediately, finding common ground in Nine Inch\n            Nails, Brainiac, and the early works of Steve Albini.\n          </p>\n\n          <p>\n            Older than they once were but not yet beyond the pale, Lone Control\n            represents a knowing outburst – a cry, not for help or attention,\n            but to rally any who might find need. Their creations are crude and\n            abrasive by design. Rarely in this age of immediacy do they find\n            meaningful value in the overwrought.{\" \"}\n          </p>\n\n          <p>\n            Lone Control’s debut is a flash in the pan, arresting, burning\n            bright while waning focus may last.
